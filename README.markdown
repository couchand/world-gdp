introduction
------------

This chart is based on one built by Max Roser as part of his project
*GDP Growth Over the Very Long Run*.  Many people responded immediately
that Max's chart really ought to be on a log scale.  [Here it is][2].

The data originally comes from the work of Angus Maddison reconstructing
historical GDP data.  More information can be found at the [Maddison
Project][1].

building the chart
------------------

You'll need to have the following tools to build the visualization:

  * make
  * curl
  * node.js
  * coffeescript

Clone the repository then just run `make`.

more information
----------------

More information about the data and reconstruction is available on [Max
Roser's page][0] as well as from the [Maddison Project][1].
